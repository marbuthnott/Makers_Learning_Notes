# makers_learning_notes

## Introduction

These are my learning notes from the start of my software engineering journey in March 2019.

I have tried to record notes on a weekly basis and have just about managed it (less a few missed weeks). They include everything from seminar notes through to step-by-step development process guides of my various projects.
