### QUESTIONS

### POLYMORPHISM

* Very similar to Object Orientated class relationships.

* Extract similar relationships into their own classes. Thereby slimming the code.

From:
```
class Expect
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def to_equal(other)
    if @value == other
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end

  def to_include(other)
    if @value.include? other
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end

  def to_respond_to(method_name)
    if @value.respond_to? method_name
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end
end
```

To:
```
class Expect
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def to(comparison)
    if comparison.compare(@value)
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end
end

class Equal
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def compare(other)
    other == @value
  end
end

class Include
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def compare(array)
    array.include?(@value)
  end
end

class RespondTo
  def initialize(method_name)
    @method_name = method_name
  end

  def compare(other)
    other.respond_to? @method_name
  end
end
```

Note the extraction of `Equal`, `Include`, and `RespondTo`.

### WEEK OVERVIEW

* w/ Mike

**Understanding the tech test**

What should we focus on?

* Process. Making sure the project's set up. i.e. Gemfile, testing framework

* DRY code. Using a linter

* Encapsulation, polymorphism, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). High cohesion / low coupling.
  - cohesion - the degree to which the elements of a module or class belong together.
  - coupling - the degree to which the various modules or classes depend on each other.

* Code is well tested.

* Test behavior and not state.

* Test in isolation.

* Diagramming/ modeling. Drawing a good request response cycle.
  - principally a good README.md

* Good small commits. Clear and consistent commit messages.

### OBJECT RECOGNITION WITH RASPBERRY PI

**TECH/FRAMEWORKS**

**Software Library:** *TensorFlow*. TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. [TensorFlow - Github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

Live object recognition (detecting objects in real time) vs. input image object detection.

* Computer vision employed in self driving cars.

**Autonomous Waste Sorting** - Object identification and object recognition

[Machine Vision Area](https://www.netguru.com/services/machine-learning)

[Image recognition apps](https://www.netguru.com/blog/11-top-image-recognition-apps-to-watch-in-2019)

**Image recognition of logos**
[Brand Logo Recognition Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nv-brand-logo-recognition2/data)

#### TENSORFLOW

Tensors:
 - are the standard way of representing data in deep learning.
 - Multi dimensional arrays(matrices). Extension of 2 dimension table

TensorFlow is then the computation involved in the management of the data flowing between these tensors:
- Computation is approached as a dataflow graph.

INPUT: Data is provided in a set of images.

INPUT DATA PASSES THROUGH TENSORFLOW EN ROUTE TO THE MODEL: With TensorFlow we train our model. Trained using deep learning. Main objective is to detect the features that could be edge cases, the hard features, facial recognition... etc

MODEL: When features are extracted by TensorFlow they are passed to the model. To test the model we use testing data from a separate source.

TEST DATA:

OUPUT: Image is converted into a numbered array in the TensorFlow object detection so the computation can be made easy.

**Tech**

- TensorFlow
- TensorBoard
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Cocoapi
- Protobuf -> Protocol Buffers is a method of serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data.


### ALGORITHM DESIGN

* w/ Alice

ALGORITHM

A set of instructions to produce a desired output from a specified input.

Analogy of a algorithm is a 'recipe':
  - a kitchen is the 'environment'
  - there are 'ingredients'
  - the 'recipe' is the algorithm
  - the 'cake' is the output

*Function Signature*:
  - name of function
  - number of parameters
  - type of parameters
  - return type

Must also consider edge cases. e.g. if there is no input? If there are equal values in input.

Algorithm design follows human logic. How the human would solve the problem and not how the code would solve the problem. As an example finding the highest number in an array would be found by comparing the first number with the next and determining which is the highest. The highest number is stored and then compared to the third number and so-on and so-forth.

Students to Groups:

Inputs:
- array of names
- number of groups

Output:
- A hash

Edge cases:
- Empty hash

1. Create a hash
2. Create key value pairs reflecting the number of groups. Value is an empty array.
3. Create assignment counter with a maximum value of the number of groups and a minimum value of 1.
4. Iterate through the names array.
5. Assign the first name to the first key in the hash.
6. Increment the assignment counter by 1.
7. Assign the next name to the key that's reflected by the assignment counter.
8. If the assignment counter reaches the maximum number of groups and there are still names in the array, reset the assignment counter to 1.

**Given a list of things (numbers or words), return all the elements that are duplicated in the list.**

1. Create a variations array to store each variation of thing.
2. Create a duplicates array to store the things that are already in the variations.
3. Iterate through the things array.
4. For each iteration check the variations array to see if it is already included.
5. If it is not included add to the variations.
6. If it is included add to the duplicates.
7. After iterating through the things array we return the unique things in the duplicates array.

QUESTIONS

### Process Review - Spell check app video

[Spellcheck - Sam Morgan](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2j379ih3o34eupl/Spellcheck.mov?dl=0)

1. Open a README.md

Set up of README.md

**Who's the user? And how do they use it?**

**Input/Output (types)**
What input and output should we expect?

**Acceptance Criteria (examples)**
Acceptance criteria? expect Given the input 'Hello world' produce output 'Hello world'. input 'Hello warld' produce output 'Hello ~warld~'

**Edge or naive cases (examples)**

Again a table with input and expected output

MAKE FIRST COMMIT

2. Initialise a Gemfile

Use `bundle init` to create a gemfile. Delete its contents bar the source rubygems.org

Specify the version of ruby. `ruby '2.6.0'`
`gem rspec`

Run `bundle install`

3. Initialise RSpec

`rspec --init`

4. Create gitignore

Create a .gitignore file and include the Gemfile.lock

5. Write first test

This is going to be a simple:

```
require 'spellchecker'

describe Spellchecker do
end
```

Write the code to pass green

6. Write the first comprehensive test.

within 'spellchecker'

```
describe '#check' do
  it 'returns an empty string when given an empty string' do
    spellchecker = described_class.new
    expect(spellchecker.check("")).to eq ""
  end
end
```

7. Refactor

extract the `spellchecker = described_class.new` as it'll be used for each test. beneath the describe Spellchecker do `subject(:spellchecker) { described_class.new }`

create a `context` for when there are no spelling mistakes.

(Pending tests have 'x' immediately before they are declared. e.g. `xcontext` or `xit`)

(Useful code: `DICTIONARY.include?(word ? word : "~#{ word }~")`)
