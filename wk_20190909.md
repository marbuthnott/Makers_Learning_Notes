### What is a message Queue?

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJbuFMyBDk)

In short a message queue is a list stored on a database of items to be acted on.

If a server crashes it is able to use a `notifier` to identify the crashed server and redirect any tasks to other servers that can accept them.

### What is an API?

**Description** - An Application Programming Interface allows two systems to communicate with one another. An API essentially provides the language and contract for how two systems interact. Each API has documentation and specifications which determine how information can be transferred.

**How they communicate** - APIs can use HTTP requests to get information from a web application or web server. Responses are varied depending on the type of web service (it could be REST or SOAP - the precursor to REST). REST uses URLs in most cases to receive or send information using four different HTTP 1.1 verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform tasks:
- GET: Read. 200(Ok) or 404(Not Found)
- POST: Create. 201(Created) or 404 / 409(Conflict)
- PUT: Update/Replace. 200 or 204(No Content)
- DELETE: 200 or 404
SOAP data is transferred in XML while REST has access to a number of data types including Command Separated Value (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and Really Simple Syndication (RSS). Point being you can obtain data that is easy to parse within the language of your application.

**Endpoints** - An endpoint is one end of a communication channel. APIs work using requests and responses. When an API requests information from a web application or web server, it will receive a response. The place where APIs send requests and where the resources live are called endpoints.
