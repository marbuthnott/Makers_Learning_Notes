### SETTING UP A VIRTUAL REALITY ENVIRONMENT

How do you set up a Gear VR environment in 

**DOWNLOAD UNITY**

It's very important you have the correct version, some may not work with Android, some may not work with IOS and so on. As we were working Android the latest version that is compatible is 2018.3.14f1.

**CONFIGURE**

Edit / Project Settings / Player / Virtual reality supported box is checked.

**MAKING A PLAYER MOVE**

Create an empty object named 'Player'. Make sure the position is 0. Also make sure that the camera is 0

Make the main camera a child of our Player.

Add component to the player of 'Rigidbody' and also 'Capsule Collider' with height '1.5', y axis '-0.5':
- Rigidbodies are components that allow a GameObject to react to real-time physics
- Capsule Collider is a capsule-shaped primitive collider.

Now add the script to make the player walk. Add new component called 'PlayerWalk'. Double click on the component you've just created and it should open VS Code.

The editor that opens will show a ready formed script. Just below the it stating a public class enter the following:
`public int playerSpeed;`

Now create the input. When we touch the screen we want our character to move; therefore, within `void Update () {`, we want:
```
if(Input.GetButton("Fire1"))
{
  transform.position = transform.position + Camera.main.transform.forward * playerSpeed * Time.deltaTime
}
```
Where does `Fire1` come from??

Got back to unity. And enter player speed variable. Give it a 10. This will allow him to move, but only forward and not left and right.

Add `GvrEditorEmulator`. Type this into the search field within the 'projects' and 'Assets' tab. Drag and drop it into the Hierachy tab of your project (where the objects are listed)

Now to add a reticle pointer. Search for `GvrReticlePointer` within the assets tab. Once found drag and drop into the main camera. There are a number of settings for colour and size but this should provide a pointer in the center of the screen.

**PROJECT SET UP FOR ANDROID**

Download the most recent GVR SDK for Unity from [link](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases). Use the most recent version. When you download you'll have the option what you want to exclude, if you're working in Android you will want to untick the iOS options.

Open a new project on unity.

Configure the environment:
- Set up the project for Android by going to File > Build Settings and selecting the Android option.
- Now on Build Settings click the Player Settings... button. Change the company and product name to reflect what you're building.
- In Player Settings... go to other settings and again change the Package name field to reflect what you're building.
- Set the minimum API Level to a minimum of Android 4.4
- Tick off `TV Compatibility`
- In the `XR Settings` tab of the `Player Settings...` list tick `Virtual Reality Supported`.

Now you can import the GVR SDK that we downloaded earlier. Do this by visiting Assets > Import Package > Custom Package... and locate the `GoogleVRForUnity` package in the downloads folder.

Add GvrEditorEmulator which will allow you to have control of the camera in the game testing environment. Do this by searching for it within your 'assets'. Once found drag and drop into the hierarchy tab.

Add the .gitignore file. Here's a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore) that will ignore all the temporary files created in the build. And here's a useful [blog](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-git-with-unity)

**Sending messages from the camera to objects**

Firstly add the `Physics Raycaster` to the main camera; this will allow the camera to send a message from the camera to an object.

Create a SelectionManager script in the Scripts folder. This will manage all selections in the programme.

Create an empty game object. Reset its transform and drag the selection manager onto the object.

In the update method of the SelectionManager script do
`var ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition)` here we make the main camera a ray
`RaycastHit hit;`
```
if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
{
  var selection = hit.transform;
  var selectionRenderer = selection.GetComponent<Renderer>();
  if (selectionRenderer != null)
}
```
 if the raycast returns true that hit object will be populated and can use it to grab the transform of the current selection.

 **Working with the raycaster and interacting with objects**

Set up a new script called `CameraObjectInteraction.cs` and make it a child of the camera you would like to use to select items.

All you'll need will be the `Update` function. The first stage is to create a raycaster whenever there is a click. Therefore:
```
if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) {
    Ray mouseray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
    RaycastHit rayhit;
}
```
This will look for a click. If there is one it will create a raycast in whichever direction the mouse is pointing.

Now to check whether or not the raycast is hitting anything:
```
if (Physics.Raycast(mouseray, out rayhit, 1000.0f)) {
}
```

And finally, if there is an object, it will grab the name perform an action depending on that name:
```
if (rayhit.transform.name == "Cube") {
    SceneManager.LoadScene("Main");
}
```
Here it checks whether the object name is 'Cube' and if it is will load the scene "Main".

### NOTES FOR REVIEW

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOCKING AND STUBBING**

**Stubbing**
A stub returns canned responses, avoiding any meaningful computation or I/O. A stub may simulate the behavior of existing code (such as a procedure on a remote machine, such methods are often called mocks) or be a temporary substitute for yet-to-be-developed code.

`allow(some_object).to receive(some_method).and_return(some_value)`

And allowing it to take an argument:

`expect(some_object).to receive(some_method).with(some_argument).and_return(some_value)`

**Mocking**
Expects specific messages; will raise an error if it doesnâ€™t receive them by the end of the example.

`expect(some_object).to receive(some_method).and_return(some_value)`

**Process**
Here's a method that we want to test:
```
def process(data, validator)
  raise Error unless validator.valid?(data)

  # simple logic to show the idea
  "#{data} processed"
end
```

**Stubbing example**
Firstly create a double of validator argument:
`let (:validator) { double(:validator) }`

Now allow it to receive `valid?` and produce a certain output:
`allow(validator).to receive(:valid?).and_return(true)`

Now you will be able to run the following test:
`expect(processor.process('foo', validator)).to eq('foo processed')`

**Mocking example**
Again create the double

If we want to make sure that object receives any message during execution, we should use a mock:
```
expect(validator).to receive(:valid?).with('foo').and_return(true)
processor.process('foo', validator)
```

**Mock and Stub methods**
Stub with;
```
allow_any_instance_of(Validator).to receive(:valid?).and_return(false)`
expect { processor.process('foo') }.to raise_error(DataProcessor::Error)
```

And mock with:
```
expect_any_instance_of(Validator).to receive(:valid?).with('foo').and_return(true)
processor.process('foo')
```

**Stubbing with a loop**

When only wanting to test one run through of `loop do` you should use the following at the top of the test:
`expect(repeater).to receive(:loop).and_yield`
This will only iterate once through the loop

**Stubbing user input**

```
allow(repeater).to receive(:gets).and_return("hello, world\n")`
expect{repeater.repeat}.to output("Say something:\n#{time} | hello, world\n").to_stdout
```
