## Week 10
## w/c 1st July 2019

### QUESTIONS

* How big will the tests be? MVC model or smaller problems.

### QUESTIONS

### POLYMORPHISM

* Very similar to Object Orientated class relationships.

* Extract similar relationships into their own classes. Thereby slimming the code.

From:
```
class Expect
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def to_equal(other)
    if @value == other
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end

  def to_include(other)
    if @value.include? other
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end

  def to_respond_to(method_name)
    if @value.respond_to? method_name
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end
end
```

To:
```
class Expect
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def to(comparison)
    if comparison.compare(@value)
      puts "Test passed"
    else
      puts "Test failed"
    end
  end
end

class Equal
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def compare(other)
    other == @value
  end
end

class Include
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def compare(array)
    array.include?(@value)
  end
end

class RespondTo
  def initialize(method_name)
    @method_name = method_name
  end

  def compare(other)
    other.respond_to? @method_name
  end
end
```

Note the extraction of `Equal`, `Include`, and `RespondTo`.

### WEEK OVERVIEW

* w/ Mike

**Understanding the tech test**

What should we focus on?

* Process. Making sure the project's set up. i.e. Gemfile, testing framework

* DRY code. Using a linter

* Encapsulation, polymorphism, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). High cohesion / low coupling.
  - cohesion - the degree to which the elements of a module or class belong together.
  - coupling - the degree to which the various modules or classes depend on each other.

* Code is well tested.

* Test behavior and not state.

* Test in isolation.

* Diagramming/ modeling. Drawing a good request response cycle.
  - principally a good README.md

* Good small commits. Clear and consistent commit messages.
